## Overview

RedTeam Terminal is a cyberpunk-themed cybersecurity CLI tool designed for security professionals, students, and enthusiasts to learn about various penetration testing techniques in a safe, educational environment.

### Features
- Network reconnaissance and port scanning
- Vulnerability assessment and reporting
- Password strength analysis
- OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tools
- Social engineering simulation
- Forensics tools
- Reporting capabilities
- Extensible architecture

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup Process
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python redteam.py
   ```

### Dependencies
- `rich` - Beautiful terminal UI
- `colorama` - Cross-platform colored output
- `pyfiglet` - ASCII art banners
- `requests` - HTTP requests
- `configparser` - Configuration file handling

## Configuration

The application uses a `config.ini` file for customization. Key configuration options include:

- **General Settings**: Theme, version, debug mode
- **Network Recon**: Scan types, timeouts, port lists
- **Vulnerability Scanner**: Severity thresholds, database URLs
- **Password Tester**: Requirements and entropy settings
- **OSINT Tools**: Rate limiting, proxy settings
- **Security**: Consent requirements, logging
- **Reporting**: Export formats, directories

## Usage

### Main Menu
```
1. Network Reconnaissance - Port scanning and network discovery
2. Vulnerability Assessment - CVE database and security scanning
3. Password Strength Tester - Analyze password security
4. OSINT Tools - holehe, h8mail, sherlock, and more
5. Social Engineering Toolkit - Phishing, pretexting, credential harvesting
6. Forensics - Disk, memory, and artifact analysis
7. Reporting - Generate and export assessment reports
8. Miscellaneous Utilities - Other useful red team tools
9. Web Attack Tools - SQLi, XSS, CSRF, directory brute force
10. Wireless Attack Tools - WiFi scanning, handshake capture
11. Exit - Quit the terminal
```

### Best Practices
1. Always obtain written authorization before testing
2. Use in controlled environments for learning
3. Follow responsible disclosure practices
4. Respect privacy and data protection laws
5. Document your findings appropriately

## Tools Overview

### Network Reconnaissance
Simulates network scanning to identify open ports and services. Features include:
- Port scanning simulation
- Service detection
- Network discovery
- Color-coded results

### Vulnerability Assessment
Assesses systems for potential vulnerabilities using simulated CVE database scanning. Features include:
- Severity-based reporting
- Detailed vulnerability descriptions
- Risk assessment

### Password Strength Tester
Analyzes password security with entropy calculation and crack time estimation. Features include:
- Real-time analysis
- Security requirement validation
- Estimated crack time

### OSINT Tools
Collection of tools for open source intelligence gathering. Includes:
- Email lookup (holehe, h8mail)
- Username searches (sherlock)
- Domain/IP information gathering (theHarvester)
